    <h1>Git and GitHub</h1>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <p>Git is a free version control system a tool which allows us to manage our source code  history. Majority of programmers use Git. Git doesnt have an interface - it runs with the terminal or windows command prompt. If you’re working with an IDE, you can also use the integrated terminal.</p>
        <p>Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is a verison control system which allows you to manage your source code history. It is a local tool - a tool that you install on your machine. GitHub is an hosting and collaboration provider which has the purpose to host you Git repositories. Pushing the code from Git to GitHub is not mandatory, but it provides an easier way to collaborate in projects, beacause it makes it easier for other people access your code.</p>
        <p>GitHub also has alternatives -  AWS code, BitBucket, Gitlap etc.</p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h3>Important Keywords</h3>
        <p><b>Repository</b> - the location where your code history is stored.</p>
        <p><b>Branch</b> -  a "folder" within the repository containing commits.</p> 
        <p><b>Commits</b> - different stages of your code inside a branch.</p>    
    </div>


    <div>
        <h3>Git Basics</h3>
        <p>If you want your project to be managed by Git, start with typing in the command "git init". Typing in command "git add ." will track the changes inside the repository. To save the current version of the code, type in "git commit -m <i>message</i>", between the quotation marks there should be a meaningful comment about the given commit. With our first commit, we automatically crerated our master branch. Also - whenever you create a new commit, it will be the head of you branch. </p>
        <p>Important thing to know is that Git doesn´t add copies of your code, it tracks changes. Git compares the new code with old code and saves changes. This makes it fast and efficient.</p>
        <p>If you make changes to your project and want to commit them, you can to that with commands "git add ." and "git commit -m <i>message</i>". If you want to see all of the commits inside of a branch, you can use command "git log". If you do that, you can see that each commit has an unique id, the author, the date and the commit message.  The last commit will become the head of the branch, as explained earlier.</p>
        <h4>Commands</h4>
        <p><code>$git init</code> - will turn our project into a project managed by Git</p>
        <p><code>$git add .</code> - will track changes in all files inside the repository</p>  
        <p><code>$git commit -m <i>"message"</i></code> - saves updated code to a new commit named “your message”</p>
        <p><code>$git log</code> - will display all commits inside our branch</p> 
        <p><code>$git status</code> - provides information about the current state.</p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h3>Previous Commits and Deleting Code</h3>
        <p>If you want to take a look at a previous code, you should use the command "git checkout <i>commit id</i>" . Our head will now be pointing at this commit, but it is no longer a part of a branch. To go back to your master branch, you should type in command "git checkout master" or "git master". Now your back in the head of the master branch.</p>
        <p>If you wish to delete some of the newer code, then you have to type in command "git reset --hard <i>commit id</i> ", where "commit id" is the id of the code you wish to keep. This will be your new head of the branch. Be careful! After deleting the commit we cannot undo this change.</p>
        <p>If you wish to delete uncommited code, use command "git checkout -- ." - this let’s us jump back to our last commit.</p>
        <h4>Commands</h4>
        <p><code>$git checkout <i>commit id</i></code> - jump to a specific commit of a branch</p>  
        <p><code>$git master</code> - takes you back to the head of the master branch</p>  
        <p><code>$git reset --hard <i>commit id</i></code> - turn the selected commit into the new head</p>  
        <p><code>$git checkout -- .</code> - let’s us jump back to our last commit</p>  
    </div>


    <div>
        <h3>Working with Branches</h3>
        <p>Why should you need a new branch? Because you dont want to mess with the working product (master branch), but you do want to make some changes in your project and test them. If you are finished, then you can merge both branches.</p>
        <p>To create a new branch, you have to type "git checkout -b <i>branch-name</i>", with "branch-name" being your chosen name for that branch. After creating the branch we’re automatically working in the latest commit of this branch. If you now add new commits, they will be saved in the new branch. This results in two heads - one in master branch and one in your new branch.</p>
        <p>To merge a selected branch with your master branch, type in command "git merge <i>branch-name</i>". This will add the changes made in your side-branch to your master branch and now your last commit is the head of both branches. After merging you might want to delete your side-branch. To do that, simply type in command "git branch -D <i>branch-name</i>".</p>
        <p>Merging branches can also cause conflicts. For example, if you have made changes in both branches. If automatic merge fails, you must solve the conflict. The conflict can be solved by deleting the code you dont want to keep. After that, commit the changes. This resolves the conflict and merges the branches successfully.</p>
        <h4>Commands</h4>
        <p><code>$git branch</code> - lists all branches in our repository</p>  
        <p><code>$git checkout -b <i>branch-name</i></code> - creates a new branch based on the latest commit of the branch you’re currently working in.</p>
        <p><code>$git merge <i>branch-name</i></code> - merges named brach with your master branch</p>
        <p><code>$git branch -D <i>branch-name</i></code> - deletes branch with given name</p>

        <h3>Uploading Code to GitHub repository</h3>
        <p>In order to push your code to GitHub first time:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You need a GitHub account. </li>
            <li>Create a remote repository in GitHub, where you can upload your code (free accounts can only create public repositories).</li>
            <li>Execute code "git remote add origin <i>url</i> ", where origin is the name of the remote repository and url is the URL of the remote repository on GitHub. You do it to establish a connection between the local and the remote repository.</li>
            <li>To push (i.e. upload) the content of our local Repository to the remote one, type in "git push -u origin master". Part of the command - "-u origin master" - instructs Git to create an upstream to a specific Branch and Repository, meaning that we want to upload data to the “master” Branch of our “origin” Repository.</li>
            <li>If Git has established a connection between your local and remote repositories, then you can push code in the future with a shorter command "git push". Dont forget to add files for Git to track (git add .) and commit changes (git commit -m <i>message</i>).</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Commands</h4>
        <p><code>git remote add origin <i>url</i></code> - establishes a connection with a remote repository, "origin" is the name of the remote repository</p>
        <p><code>git push -u origin master</code> - upload code from your local branch to a remote branch in the remote repository, origin is the name of the remote repository and master is the name of the remote branch</p>
        <p><code>git remote</code> - shows the remote repository we created on GitHub</p>
        <p><code>git remote -v</code> - displays connections to  remote repositories and shows their url-s</p>
        <p><code>git branch -r</code> - displays the remote tracking Branch</p>
        <p><code>git push</code> - upload code from repository</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Clone and Download Remote Repositories</h3>
        <p>To clone code from GitHub simply create an empty folder and with the command "git clone url" copy the code to your folder. </p>
        <p>To download the code you can either use command "git pull" or a combination of "git fetch" and "git merge".</p>
        <p><code>git clone <i>url</i></code> - clones an entire remote repository to your local folder. Automatically creates a remote tracking branch.</p>
        <p><code>git fetch</code> -  updates the remote tracking Branch with the code from the remote branch.</p>
        <p><code>git pull</code> runs "git fetch" with the given parameters and calls "git merge" to merge the retrieved branch heads into the current branch.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Delete Remote Repositories</h3>
        <p>First option: go to your repository &#x2192 settings &#x2192 Danger zone &#x2192 delete this repository &#x2192 enter repository name &#x2192 press enter</p>
        <p>Second option: terminal &#x2192  git remote rm origin &#x2192 press enter</p>
        <h4>Commands</h4>
        <p><code>git remote rm origin</code> - terminates the connection between remote and local repository, “origin” is the remote repository`s name</p>
